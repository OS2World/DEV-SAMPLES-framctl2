 Welcome to the 2nd article in our series on frame controls!  If you
 have suggestions on articles you would like to see, please forward
 them to us.    If you're familiar with VisualAge C++ for OS/2 V3.0
 or its predecessor, C Set++ V2.1, the manifestation of this concept
 is provided via the Open Class Library class,
 IFrameExtension.

 Future articles that we plan to write include support for JAVA applets in
 OS/2 Warp V4.0, the new Dynamic Job Properties support for printing in OS/2
 Warp V4.0, and how to enable your custom controls for use within the
 IMultiCellCanvas class that is part of the Open Class Library.


 Enjoy!
